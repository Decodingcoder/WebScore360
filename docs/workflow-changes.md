# WebScore360 Workflow Changes

## Temporary Workflow Adjustments

We have made temporary adjustments to the WebScore360 workflow due to the unavailability of SMTP credentials. Here is how the current workflow operates:

### Current Workflow

1. **User submits a website for analysis**
   - User enters a website URL and email address
   - The system creates an analysis job in the database
   - User is redirected to create/login to their account

2. **Score generation process**
   - The worker service picks up the analysis job
   - Analyzes the website and generates scores for various categories
   - Creates a PDF report with detailed results
   - Stores the PDF in Supabase Storage
   - Updates the database with score results and PDF URL
   - **No email is sent** (this step is temporarily disabled)

3. **Accessing reports**
   - Users can view their reports in the dashboard
   - PDF reports can be downloaded directly from the dashboard
   - Results are displayed in the audits section

### Technical Implementation Notes

- The email sending functionality remains in the codebase but is skipped during execution
- The PDF generation and storage in Supabase Storage continue to function normally
- All database records and data structures remain unchanged to ensure compatibility with future email functionality

### Future Restoration

When SMTP credentials become available:

1. The email sending step will be re-enabled in the worker processor
2. UI messages will be updated to reflect that reports are sent via email
3. No database or storage changes will be required

## Additional Information

The PDF reports contain the same detailed information that would have been sent via email. The dashboard provides full access to historical reports and analysis results.
