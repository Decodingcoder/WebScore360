# WebScore360 Worker Implementation

## Architecture Overview

The WebScore360 worker is a Node.js service built with TypeScript that runs as a background process to handle website analysis and reporting. The architecture follows a modular approach:

### Core Components:

1. **Queue Processor**
   - Uses Bull and Redis to manage job queues
   - Provides job retry mechanisms and failure handling
   - Handles graceful shutdowns

2. **Analysis Engine**
   - Modular architecture with separate analyzers for each category
   - Implements the scoring algorithm from specifications
   - Uses Cheerio for HTML parsing and Axios for HTTP requests

3. **PDF Generator**
   - Uses pdf-lib to create professional reports
   - Implements the report design from specifications
   - Stores PDFs in Supabase Storage

4. **Email Service**
   - Uses Nodemailer for email delivery
   - Implements branded HTML email templates
   - Includes the PDF as an attachment

5. **Database Integration**
   - Uses Supabase client to store analysis results
   - Updates user's remaining audit counts
   - Maintains audit history

## Implementation Status

Files created in this implementation:

- Basic project setup (package.json, tsconfig.json)
- Main worker entry point (src/index.ts)
- Queue setup (src/queue/setup.ts, src/queue/processor.ts)
- Analysis components (src/analysis/analyzer.ts, src/analysis/performance.ts, src/analysis/seo.ts)
- PDF generation (src/pdf/generator.ts)
- Email delivery (src/services/email.ts)
- Supporting utilities (src/utils/logger.ts, src/config/supabase.ts)
- Documentation (README.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md)

## Next Steps

To complete the implementation:

1. **Create remaining analysis modules**:
   - src/analysis/conversion.ts
   - src/analysis/branding.ts
   - src/analysis/presence.ts

2. **Implement sitemap check**:
   - Add HTTP request to check sitemap.xml existence

3. **Install dependencies**:
   - Run `pnpm install` to install all required packages

4. **Add tests**:
   - Write unit tests for each analysis module
   - Add integration tests for the full flow

5. **Setup CI/CD**:
   - Configure Render deployment
   - Set up environment variables
   - Create deployment pipeline

6. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Implement more robust logging
   - Add performance monitoring
   - Set up alerts for failures

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Render account
   - Supabase project
   - Redis instance (can be a Render add-on)
   - Google PageSpeed Insights API key
   - SMTP service for emails

2. **Render Setup**:
   - Create a new Background Worker
   - Connect to GitHub repository
   - Set build command: `pnpm install && pnpm build`
   - Set start command: `node dist/index.js`
   - Configure environment variables from `.env`

3. **Scaling**:
   - Start with a single worker instance
   - Scale based on job queue size and processing times
   - Monitor memory usage and CPU load

## Notes on Implementation Decisions

1. **Bull Queue vs. Other Options**:
   - Bull was chosen for its robust retry mechanisms and Redis integration
   - Redis provides persistence and ability to monitor the queue

2. **Cheerio vs. Puppeteer**:
   - Cheerio is used for most static HTML analysis (faster, less resource-intensive)
   - Puppeteer would be needed for more complex checks requiring JavaScript execution

3. **PDF Generation**:
   - pdf-lib was chosen for its pure JavaScript implementation
   - More complex layouts could be achieved with Puppeteer rendering HTML to PDF

4. **Error Handling**:
   - All major operations are wrapped in try/catch blocks
   - Failed jobs are retained in the queue for inspection
   - Errors are logged with context for debugging
