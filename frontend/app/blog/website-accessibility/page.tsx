      <p className="text-xl mb-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        In today&apos;s digital world, having an accessible website isn&apos;t
        just a nice-to-have—it&apos;s essential. Web accessibility ensures that
        people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and
        interact with your website. And while it might seem like a niche
        concern, the reality is that approximately 15% of the global population
        lives with some form of disability.

        Why Accessibility Matters
      </h2>

      <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
        Web accessibility isn&apos;t just about doing the right thing (though
        that&apos;s important too). Here are compelling reasons to prioritize
        it:
      </p>
      <ul className="mb-6 list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
        <li>
          <strong>Larger Audience:</strong> An accessible website can reach more
          people, including the 1+ billion individuals worldwide with
          disabilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> Many countries have laws requiring
          digital accessibility (like the ADA in the US or the Equality Act in
          the UK).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Better User Experience:</strong> Accessibility improvements
          often make a website better for everyone, not just users with
          disabilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>SEO Benefits:</strong> Many accessibility best practices align
          with SEO best practices, potentially improving your search rankings.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">
        Common Accessibility Issues (and How to Fix Them)
      </h2>

      <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
        Here are some frequent accessibility problems and practical solutions:
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">1. Poor Color Contrast</h3>
      <p className="mb-3 text-lg">
        <strong>The Problem:</strong> Text that doesn&apos;t stand out clearly
        from its background is difficult to read for many users, especially
        those with visual impairments or color blindness.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-3 text-lg">
        <strong>The Fix:</strong> Ensure sufficient contrast between text and
        background colors. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
        recommend a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for
        large text. Use tools like the WebAIM Contrast Checker to verify your
        color choices.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
        <strong>WebScore360 Angle:</strong> Color contrast issues are directly
        flagged in our accessibility analysis, making them easy to identify and
        fix.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">
        2. Missing Alt Text for Images
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-3 text-lg">
        <strong>The Problem:</strong> Screen readers can&apos;t interpret images
        without alternative text, meaning users with visual impairments miss
        important content.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-3 text-lg">
        <strong>The Fix:</strong> Add descriptive alt text to all meaningful
        images on your site. The alt text should convey the purpose or content
        of the image. For decorative images that don&apos;t add content value,
        use an empty alt attribute (alt=&quot;&quot;) to let screen readers know
        they can skip it.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
        <strong>WebScore360 Angle:</strong> Our analysis scans for missing alt
        text across your site, helping you identify images that need attention.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">
        3. Keyboard Navigation Issues
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-3 text-lg">
        <strong>The Problem:</strong> Many users can&apos;t use a mouse and rely
        on keyboard navigation instead. If your site isn&apos;t properly coded
        for keyboard use, these visitors can&apos;t access all your content.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-3 text-lg">
        <strong>The Fix:</strong> Ensure all interactive elements (links,
        buttons, form controls) can be accessed and operated using only the
        keyboard. The tab order should be logical, and the current focus should
        be visibly indicated. Test your site by navigating through it using only
        the Tab key.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
        <strong>WebScore360 Angle:</strong> Keyboard accessibility is an
        important factor in your overall accessibility score, reflecting how
        inclusive your site is to all users.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">
        4. Non-Descriptive Link Text
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-3 text-lg">
        <strong>The Problem:</strong> Links that say &quot;click here&quot; or
        &quot;read more&quot; don&apos;t provide context when read in isolation
        (as they often are by screen readers).
      </p>
      <p className="mb-3 text-lg">
        <strong>The Fix:</strong> Use descriptive link text that makes sense out
        of context. Instead of &quot;click here,&quot; use text that describes
        where the link goes or what action it performs, like &quot;View our
        pricing plans&quot; or &quot;Read full accessibility guidelines.&quot;
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6 text-lg">

        non-descriptive link patterns, helping you identify opportunities to
