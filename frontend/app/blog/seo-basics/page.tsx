        What is SEO and Why Does it Matter?
      </h2>

      <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
        Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the practice of optimizing your
        website to increase its visibility when people search for products or
        services related to your business on search engines like Google or Bing.
        The higher your pages rank in search results, the more likely you are to
        get attention and attract prospective customers.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
        Why does this matter? Consider these statistics:
      </p>

      <ul className="mb-6 list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
        <li>
          <strong>
            93% of all online experiences begin with a search engine
          </strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>75% of users never scroll past the first page</strong> of
          search results
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>70-80% of users ignore paid search results</strong>, focusing
          on organic listings
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
        Without good SEO, your website is essentially invisibleâ€”no matter how
        good your products, services, or content might be.

        Essential SEO Elements (That Actually Move the Needle)
      </h2>

      <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
        Let&apos;s focus on the most important elements of SEO that can make a
        real difference for your website&apos;s visibility:
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">
        1. Title Tags and Meta Descriptions
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-3 text-lg">
        <strong>What They Are:</strong> Title tags are HTML elements that define
        the title of a webpage. Meta descriptions are short summaries that
        appear beneath the title in search results.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-3 text-lg">
        <strong>How to Optimize:</strong> Include your primary keyword in your
        title tag, preferably near the beginning. Keep titles under 60
        characters to avoid truncation in search results. Write compelling meta
        descriptions under 160 characters that encourage clicks while including
        relevant keywords.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
        <strong>WebScore360 Angle:</strong> Our analysis checks if your website
        has proper title tags and meta descriptions, directly impacting your SEO
        Health score. Missing or poorly optimized elements are flagged as
        opportunities to improve.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">2. Heading Structure</h3>
      <p className="mb-3 text-lg">
        <strong>What It Is:</strong> Headings (H1, H2, H3, etc.) organize your
        content and help search engines understand its structure and importance.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-3 text-lg">
        <strong>How to Optimize:</strong> Use a single H1 tag for the main title
        of your page. Structure content with H2s for main sections and H3s for
        subsections. Include relevant keywords in headings naturally, but
        don&apos;t force them.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
        <strong>WebScore360 Angle:</strong> We verify that each page has exactly
        one H1 heading and a logical structure of headings throughout the
        content, which affects your SEO score.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">3. Quality Content</h3>
      <p className="mb-3 text-lg">
        <strong>What It Is:</strong> Content that satisfies user search intent,
        answers their questions, and provides value.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-3 text-lg">
        <strong>How to Optimize:</strong> Create in-depth, original content that
        addresses what your audience is searching for. Aim for at least 300
        words for most pages, and 1,000+ words for pillar content. Include your
        target keywords naturally without overstuffing. Update content regularly
        to keep it fresh.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
        <strong>WebScore360 Angle:</strong> While content quality is subjective,
        our analysis examines basic content elements that contribute to search
        visibility, such as word count, keyword usage, and freshness.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">4. Image Optimization</h3>
      <p className="mb-3 text-lg">
        <strong>What It Is:</strong> Making images search-engine friendly
        through proper naming, sizing, and descriptions.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-3 text-lg">
        <strong>How to Optimize:</strong> Use descriptive, keyword-rich
        filenames for images (e.g., &quot;blue-denim-jeans.jpg&quot; instead of
        &quot;IMG12345.jpg&quot;). Always add alt text that accurately describes
        the image and includes relevant keywords when appropriate. Compress
        images to improve page load speed.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
        <strong>WebScore360 Angle:</strong> Our analysis checks if your images
        have proper alt attributes, which affects both your SEO score and
        accessibility rating.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">
        5. Mobile-Friendly Design
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-3 text-lg">
        <strong>What It Is:</strong> A website that functions well and looks
        good on mobile devices.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-3 text-lg">
        <strong>How to Optimize:</strong> Implement responsive design that
        adapts to different screen sizes. Ensure text is readable without
        zooming, touch elements are well-spaced, and nothing important is hidden
        on mobile. Test your site on various devices to ensure it works well.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
        <strong>WebScore360 Angle:</strong> Mobile-friendliness is a crucial
        ranking factor. Our analysis evaluates your site&apos;s mobile
        experience and highlights any issues that could affect rankings.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Technical SEO Basics</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
        Beyond content and on-page elements, these technical aspects are
        critical:
      </p>

      <ul className="mb-6 list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
        <li>
          <strong>XML Sitemap:</strong> Create and submit an XML sitemap to help
          search engines find and index all your important pages.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Page Speed:</strong> Fast-loading pages rank better and
          provide a better user experience. Optimize images, leverage browser
          caching, and minimize code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Secure Connection (HTTPS):</strong> Security is a ranking
          factor. Ensure your website has an SSL certificate and loads securely.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>URL Structure:</strong> Use clean, descriptive URLs that
          include keywords when possible (e.g., yourdomain.com/blue-denim-jeans
          rather than yourdomain.com/product?id=12345).
        </li>
      </ul>
